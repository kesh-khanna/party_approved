# party_approved
DIS final project, KU Spring 2023
## Usage:
The Party Approved Playlist (PAP) website allows users to rank their public Spotify playlist against their own playlists and playlists of other users who have submitted it to the website, in two tables: User playlist and Global leader board.
The schema of the database and website is that given the submitted Spotify username the 10 most recent playlists are submitted to the global database with an estimated popularity score, playlist cover and playlist ID as the primary key for the database and updating the user to the user list.
The key technologies utilised for this project is the spotifyAPI, Postgres and Flask.


## Requirements:
Run the following code to install the necessary modules
> $ pip install -r requirements.txt

## Database initialisation:
To initialise the database, firstly create a new database in postgres, then create the file database.ini, this file should include the following:

[postgresql]
host=localhost
database= {DATABASE NAME}
user=postgres
password= {USER PASSWORD}

## SpotifyAPI authorization:
For Spotify authorisation, follow the instructions given on Spotify Developer and create an app. Once the app is created continue to the app dashboard, then settings, this will provide a client ID and a client secret. Create the file .env, which should include the following:
CLIENT_ID = '{CLIENT ID}'
CLIENT_SECRET = '{CLIENT SECRET}'

Note: This step is only required for app.py. Offline data is available for use with app_tester.py that doesnâ€™t require the spotifyAPI.


## Running the program
### with SpotifyAPI authorization:
To launch the program, run app.py, then follow to the local web address. Here the user will be prompted to enter a Spotify username and select 'subimt'. Once submitted, the user will be able to see their 10 most recent playlists ordered by the popularity score and a global leader board of the top 25 ranked playlists. 

If the user does not wish to submit their spotify account and playlists, they can view the existing global leaderboard by selecting the 'View Global Leaderboard'.

If the user wishes to submit another spotify account or resubmit the current account, navigate back to the inital landing page and following the same prompts. If the user has changed any of their playlists this will be relfected by the upated popularilty score and potental ranking in the top 25.


### without SpotifyAPI authorization:
To launch the program, run app_tester.py, then follow to the local web page .... same as above.

When promtpted to enter a Spotify username, use any of the following:
>t8dirk2ywdhlc05rskt372atf
>raef100
>9amest
>rorymccarthy40-ie
As a test version of the program that doesn't require the spotify Authorization, the data for these spotify accounts is provided in testing_data.csv. The user will not be able to get live data from spotify about the accounts and assosciated playlists.
